        <p>What is the current status of stray animals and protection laws in China?</p>
        <p>With over <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/24/china-local-governments-launch-crackdown-on-dogs-after-child-was-mauled">40 million stray dogs and 53 million stray cats</a>, as reported in the 2021 China Pet Industry White Paper, this staggering number is compounded by China's 2019 ranking as the fifth country with the highest number of rabies deaths, according to the International Journal of Infectious Diseases.</p>
        <p>However, in recent years, thanks to the widespread use of smartphones and the rapid spread of social media, some stray cat rescue groups in China have been able to quickly deploy their rescue operations. They carry out TNR (Trap, Neuter, Return) for stray cats, and some affectionate strays are fortunate enough to be adopted, thus rewriting their nomadic fate.</p>
        <p>Here are two representative stories that showcase the current state of stray cat rescue in China, which you can view by clicking on the images below.</p>
