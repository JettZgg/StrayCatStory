    <section class="news-content">
        <p>You might often see cats on the streets of Turkey or even at subway station turnstiles on short video platforms. But have you ever wondered about the relationship between stray cats and people in China, the world's third-largest country by area, where the weather in most cities is suitable for cats, and how they are treated?</p>
        <p>In China, there is an app called <a href="https://streetcat.wiki/index.php/Main_Page" target="_blank">Hello Street Cat</a>, designed with the initial intention of rescuing stray cats by broadcasting them live on the internet. The company developing this product deploys their smart cat shelters in street corners and areas frequently visited by stray cats. These shelters are equipped with cameras for live streaming and a smart cat food dispenser. Viewers can make small donations (even one yuan is enough) while watching the live feed, which will trigger the dispenser to release cat food and water for nutritional support to the cats.</p>
        <p>However, merely feeding the stray cats is not enough. To prevent overpopulation, the app's corresponding offline staff also try to carry out TNR (Trap, Neuter, Return) as much as possible. Neutering is often beneficial for stray cats as it keeps them calmer, thereby avoiding fights among them, and also prevents many unnecessary diseases.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the internet, some cats make amusing faces or actions in front of the live cameras. These live snippets and memes spread virally on social media, attracting more people to participate in the rescue of these stray cats.</p>
