            <p>In Shanghai, a government-affiliated nonprofit foundation has established "Cat Island," where they have taken in over 400 stray cats. The entire population of Cat Island is available for adoption. Similarly, many "cat cafes" in the city offer a space where people can befriend and potentially take home a neutered, albeit shy, kitty.</p>
            <p>China does not have an equivalent of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Instead, grassroots organizations like these take on the responsibility to save cats — from the streets or from those who believe they are better off culled.</p>
            <p>As living standards have risen, so has the view of animals changed. Younger Chinese are increasingly sharing their homes with pets — often instead of having babies — and can regularly be seen walking their cats in clear backpack carriers or on leashes.</p>
            <p>Cat island is concentrating on trapping and neutering strays, then returning them to the communities where they were found. When that's not possible, they're rehomed to Cat Island. Waiting for someone to adopt them.</p>
